# Feature-synthesis
This algorithm would be able to automatically generate features from data, which could then be used to build machine learning models.
This algorithm uses a variety of techniques to generate features from data. For example, it can use one-hot encoding to encode categorical features. It can also use feature hashing to encode high-dimensional features.
